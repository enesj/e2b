1. **Scrapy**: All the files share the Scrapy library as a dependency. Scrapy is used for creating the web scraper and handling the extraction of data.

2. **JSON**: The JSON module is shared between the files as it is used to store the scraped data in a structured format.

3. **Items**: The `items.py` file defines the data schema for the scraped data. This schema is shared across `reddit_scraper.py`, `pipelines.py`, and `reddit_spider.py` as they need to know what data to extract and how to process it.

4. **Pipelines**: The `pipelines.py` file defines how the scraped data should be processed and stored. This is shared with `reddit_scraper.py` and `reddit_spider.py` as they need to send the scraped data to the pipeline for processing.

5. **Settings**: The `settings.py` file contains settings for the Scrapy spider. These settings are shared across all the files as they dictate the behavior of the spider and the scraping process.

6. **RedditSpider**: The `reddit_spider.py` file defines the RedditSpider class which is used to scrape data from Reddit. This class is shared with `reddit_scraper.py` as it needs to instantiate the spider to start the scraping process.

7. **MarkupRemover**: The `markup_remover.py` file defines the MarkupRemover class which is used to remove the Markup from Python files. This class is shared with `reddit_scraper.py` as it needs to use it to clean the scraped data.

8. **DOM Elements**: The id names of DOM elements that the RedditSpider will interact with are shared across `reddit_scraper.py` and `reddit_spider.py`. These id names are used to locate the elements on the webpage from which data needs to be extracted.

9. **Function Names**: Function names such as `parse`, `process_item`, `remove_markup` are shared across multiple files as they are used to perform specific tasks in the scraping process.
